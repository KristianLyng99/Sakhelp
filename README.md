# Date Utility

This small web app provides helpers for working with sickness dates and calculating durations.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a browser. The page includes React, Tailwind, and the Inter font via CDN, so no build step is required.

Paste raw data and click **Autofyll** to populate the form. You can copy each field using the corresponding button.

## Hosting

You can host this project on GitHub Pages:

1. Commit the files to a Git repository.
2. Push the repository to GitHub.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings using the `main` branch.

The site will then be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repository>/`.
